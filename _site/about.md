## About Me

My name is Nelson Raphael and I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering major and German minor that attends the Georgia Institute of Technology.

## My interests

In my spare time I enjoy reading technology articles and lifting weights.

## My involvements

During my undergraduate career I have been involved in the National Society of Black Engineers as the Pre College Initiative Chair for the Georgia Tech Chapter and the 2017 and 2018 Region III Regional Leadership Conference Chair. I am a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Incorporated and I have served as the Nu Beta Chapter President and Chapter Treasurer. Outside of the classroom I am also a Student Ambassador for Georgia Tech.
