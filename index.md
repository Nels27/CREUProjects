### Shape Based Traversal of a Robotic Snake on an Uneven Terrain

**Introduction**

Welcome to my research blog. Here you can find weekly updates on my research project for the entire 2017-2018 school year. Before I can update you a little bit of background is required. My research partners are Michelle George, Elizabeth Prucka, and Stephen Williams. Our overarching goal is to create a closed loop process for an autonomous snake to use visual and sensory data to determine correct motion trajectories to move across a varying 2-dimensional environment.

Right now we have successfully completed the visual modeling portion for the project and are using the data output from the process to help the robot deliberate through with motion primitives should be executed. A motion primitive can be understood to be a certain behavior of motion for the robot to perform with the end goal of pushing against, pulling against or climbing on top of an obstacle. These primitives can be broken down into sub-behaviors that are more descriptive of their actual execution.
