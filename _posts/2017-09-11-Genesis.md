# Welcome to my Research Blog
In the beginning there was nothing....just kidding we had something.

Welcome to my first blog post. Let's get you up to speed regarding my research. After some careful code reorganization and debugging we have completed the visual processing portion of the project. This now gives us more information regarding the environment that the robotic snake is in. We can get exact information that helps us traverse obstacles and engage particular motion primitives.

We will have to rebuild the snake and this time all of the joints will move solely in the x and y plane, however, these small changes will have to be made to the code to adapt to the new dimensions of the snake.

I can illustrate a little bit more here. So the current closed loop process uses object oriented classes that house the information for the snake, the environment, and other things respectively. Therefore when instantiating the Snake model class object we have to pass in the rotational angles, the displacement between each motor joint that moves in the plane we want, and the tailframe in SE2 notation.

So it would look like this.

```markdown

Syntax highlighted code block

%MATLAB program
d = [50,100,150,200,250,300]; %These values would have to change due to the new displacement.  
rot = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0];
tailframe = SE2([0,0],0)
snk = SnakeModel(d,rot,tailframe);

%these are merely arbitrary values to illustrate the example
```
